1) It is better to use the deadlock prevention when we are able to break one of the conditions for the deadlocks and the performance is less import than 
the stability of the system (if we don't want to have deadlocks and to recover them)
2) It is better to use the deadlock avoidance when we care about performance but still do not want to have deadlocks, when we know about future requests of 
resources by processes and their releases of resources and when we are in a safe state
3) It is better to use the deadlock recovery when we care about the performance, when we do not about future requests of processes and when we are already in unsafe 
state
