When the size of the buffer increases, the less context switcheshappens, fewer times we need to copy the information from ex3_input.txt to ex3_output.txt and so on. It leads to the increasing of speed of the operation.
When we include the O_SYNC flag, we need to spend more time for synchrozination, so the speed of the operation decreases.
