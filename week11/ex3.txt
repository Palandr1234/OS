The difference between these two programs is the following: 
1) in the first program, string "Hello" does not contain "\n" so it remains in the buffer; after the fork() the buffer is copied; after the printf("\n") both buffers get "\n" and we print strings from both buffers
2) whereas in the second program, string "Hello\n" contains "\n" so it first is printed and then is copied. That's the reason why after fork() only two "\n"s are printed
